{"hypothesis": "he's going to have to worry about that next year", "idx": 121, "label": "entailment", "premise": "A: and then once they do get elected, they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised, you know, beforehand. B: Right. A: You know, maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place, you know, like the no new taxes thing. You know, that's, uh, with the economy going the way it is and everything, that was nearly ridiculous thing to, even try to do. B: Yeah.  Yeah. Well, I don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year."}
{"hypothesis": "the contract went to Lockheed", "idx": 217, "label": "neutral", "premise": "A: Uh, I saw Seven Eleven that was hiring. B: Well, I'm sure with the new, uh, contract awarding I think it went to Lockheed, didn't it?"}
{"hypothesis": "the girl whose hat Roger Kenyon had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage", "idx": 73, "label": "neutral", "premise": "At length she decided that there was nothing to be gained by worrying her. Probably there was some quite innocent explanation, which Roger Kenyon would give her when she returned the wallet - if, indeed, it were his. And yet why had his manner changed so abruptly when he learned that the girl whose hat he had rescued was going to live at Sunset Cottage?"}
{"hypothesis": "the great muscles of the dragon's wings sent ripplings down the stomach walls", "idx": 88, "label": "neutral", "premise": "She longed for a weapon, for even a hairpin, and knowing that she did not have one, she knew too that she was totally defenceless, unarmed and alone. She could feel the great flight of the dragon and sensed that she was high in air and travelling fast towards the sunset. She could feel the great muscles of the dragon's wings send ripplings down the stomach walls and she gave herself over to death."}
{"hypothesis": "eliminating all witnesses would have needed much persuasion", "idx": 26, "label": "entailment", "premise": "I should dearly have liked to know whether they were Europeans or Americans, but I couldn't hear the accents. They appeared to be arguing. I hoped the white men weren't telling him to eliminate all witnesses because I don't believe it would have needed much persuasion."}
{"hypothesis": "the American people are being shortchanged by the news coverage", "idx": 175, "label": "entailment", "premise": "A: I spend a lot of time reading about these things. I'm quite interested. I find it very exciting for the coverage we have now, today. B: Yes and I think we do get pretty good coverage. I don't feel that the American people is being shortchanged by uh, the news coverage."}
{"hypothesis": "any of the three kings stands a chance of ever making a comeback with him", "idx": 27, "label": "entailment", "premise": "But the damage was done as far as my faith was concerned, which is probably why I went mad. So anyway, that Christmas Eve night confirmed my worst fears, it was like a kind of ``royal flush'' for the infant Jimbo. All three kings - Pa Santa and the King of Kings - all down the pan together... And to be honest I don't believe any of them stands a chance of ever making a comeback with me."}
{"hypothesis": "digging was such hard work", "idx": 35, "label": "neutral", "premise": "Miss Martindale had had a school, but her rigid ideas and stern manner had frightened the children, and their parents had taken them away. And gradually the school declined, until she had to give it up and retire to end her days in the white cottage with the inevitable cat as her only companion. Breeze had never imagined that digging was such hard work."}
{"hypothesis": "Tara was only the housekeeper", "idx": 64, "label": "entailment", "premise": "She swallowed hard, unsure if she had the nerve to go ahead. The memory of the pain in Tara's eyes last night decided her. Did he really expect her to believe that Tara was only the housekeeper?"}
{"hypothesis": "she likes a lot of the very modern rock and roll", "idx": 229, "label": "entailment", "premise": "B: Well, that's kind of the way I feel about rock and roll sometimes, too, I guess. They don't really, has kind of the same sound over and over, and the other thing I don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are A: Um. Right. B: you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs which probably is just as well on some of them, too. A: Yeah. And I can't say that I like a lot of the very modern, uh, rock and roll,"}
{"hypothesis": "Guido's brain was whirring", "idx": 10, "label": "neutral", "premise": "``Do you mind if I use your phone?'' Ronni could see that Guido's brain was whirring."}
{"hypothesis": "rehabilitation is effective", "idx": 153, "label": "entailment", "premise": "B: I mean, you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape from prison and do it again. A: Right.  And then do it all over again.  Uh-huh. B: And I don't think that rehabilitation is effective."}
{"hypothesis": "it's done", "idx": 132, "label": "entailment", "premise": "B: That's true. A: So. B: Uh, the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent and I really don't, uh, agree with that. I don't think anyone who would commit uh, a crime that would get them the death penalty would stop at the moment and say, well, I was about to kill and dismember this person but, oh, if they catch me they're going to kill me so I better not do it. I just, don't think uh, that it works that way. A: Yeah.  I don't think it's done."}
{"hypothesis": "Sara might be interested in its money-making propensity at the end of the year", "idx": 97, "label": "neutral", "premise": "Matthew rode on feeling a little more at peace with himself. He skirted the spruce plantation and supposed that at some point he should tell Sara about it. He could imagine that she might be interested in its money-making propensity at the end of the year."}
{"hypothesis": "she really enjoys it", "idx": 230, "label": "entailment", "premise": "A: so I watch the fish, you know. Whatever I can do to keep myself occupied. I like to have the TV on, because that usually keeps me, um, more occupied. It kind of takes the time away and I don't realize, that's really the only time I ever watch TV, is when I'm on the bike. and then usually after I'm done riding the bike, just to cool myself down, I usually take a walk, you know, and that just kind of uh, gets me, you know, to where I'm not quite as tired I guess. But it's definitely a task. B: You think so? A: I can't say that I really enjoy it."}
{"hypothesis": "Selden was running as he screamed", "idx": 94, "label": "neutral", "premise": "How did Selden know that the hound was following him? We know he ran a long way. He was screaming for a long time before he fell and we could hear that he was running as he screamed."}
{"hypothesis": "he could really get killed that easily", "idx": 120, "label": "entailment", "premise": "B: boy, he's a big one. A: he's pretty big. That's why it really surprises me, you know, that he hasn't come back, because, like I said, he's never gone away like this before, and, I would think, you know, I mean, he might could get hurt by a car or something. I don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big."}
{"hypothesis": "there was a natural tendency on her part to hint that there was a good professional motive behind her request", "idx": 24, "label": "neutral", "premise": "That is to say, I did not take sufficient account of the fact that at that time of the day, what Mr Farraday enjoys is a conversation of a lighthearted, humorous sort. Knowing this to be his likely mood when I brought in the tea yesterday afternoon, and being aware of his general propensity to talk with me in a bantering tone at such moments, it would certainly have been wiser not to have mentioned Miss Kenton at all. But you will perhaps understand that there was a natural tendency on my part in asking what was after all a generous favour from my employer to hint that there was a good professional motive behind my request."}
{"hypothesis": "wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds", "idx": 70, "label": "neutral", "premise": "At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds piercing the weak spot in their armour?"}
{"hypothesis": "falling in love had happened", "idx": 47, "label": "neutral", "premise": "It - the tractor, the boys and the bulbs in the earth - knew she had chosen for them and was coming back to them. Of course there was still love, there was healthy, growing love and its name was called Work. She had fallen in love with it so slowly and gently and sweetly that she had never noticed it had happened."}
{"hypothesis": "Mr Knightley is a man in a million", "idx": 54, "label": "neutral", "premise": "Her priggishness. I admire it. I know she does wrong things she tries to organize other people's lives she can't see Mr Knightley is a man in a million."}
{"hypothesis": "Nevil was out of harm's way", "idx": 28, "label": "entailment", "premise": "He had seen something I should have, which was a car turning in from Soho Square and coming up behind me. My right foot hovered over the accelerator pedal and I balanced Armstrong on the clutch. I wasn't as convinced as Malpass that Nevil was out of harm's way."}
{"hypothesis": "she went to some of them", "idx": 146, "label": "entailment", "premise": "A: Do you go to museums in Europe? B: Uh, actually, no, I don't think I went to any of them."}
{"hypothesis": "the Deputy Under Secretary was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London", "idx": 114, "label": "neutral", "premise": "The Deputy Under Secretary could talk of his host's prospects and disappointments, he could learn of the problems of digging out foreign exchange and hard currency in the Third World, the tribulations over the renewal of Residence Permits, the difficulties of keeping reliable servants, but of his own world he must remain silent. The Deputy Under Secretary headed the Secret Intelligence Service of the United Kingdom, and that was not a subject matter for gossip and conversation on a bougainvillaea-fringed veranda as the lights of the fishermen's dug-outs floated inside the coral reef... No bloody way. He was a man who could be honest with himself and in honesty he could say that he was both pleased and relieved to be back at his desk on a grey Monday morning in London."}
{"hypothesis": "he doesn't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation", "idx": 25, "label": "neutral", "premise": "But don't dilly-dally for too long. Once it's published we are all going to look a little risible if we have made no adjustments to what is after all known as being predominantly my own design of gallery. Also I am a bit older than the rest of you but you can perhaps understand that I don't want to drop dead without a proper and public recantation."}
